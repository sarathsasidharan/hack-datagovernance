## Granular Access

This access layer is non negotiable for sensitive data access. This would require the data owner to explicitly give access to sensitive information , by checking if the requestor for this data is legally obliged to see this data or not.

These are highly recommended for sensitive data set access. Ideally we only have one case to handle here.

- Highly sensitive data access
