# Tag Based Access

## Data Set Automatically classified by tag based policies

For large scale enterprises it would be beneficial for systems to be self sufficient and handle governance through automation. In order to achieve this tag based polices could be leveraged which automatically provides access to data , rather than having to wait for data owners to approve this manually.

This needs to be well though of since , it is debatable to have automated access granted without a gated intervention. This auto classification could be applied for semi sensitive and non sensitive data.

There are multiple options on different cloud vendors on how this can be achieved. For this hackathon , we will dive into [Azure Attribute Based Access Controls](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/conditions-overview#:~:text=For%20more%20information%2C%20see%20Supplemental%20Terms%20of%20Use,principal%20access%20to%20a%20resource%20based%20on%20attributes.)
